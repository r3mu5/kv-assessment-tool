2. install libprocps3-dev or libprocps4-dev package
   libprocps4-dev depends on libsystemd-dev

Some distros, such as Ubuntu 16.04 have moved to libprocps4-dev. When

on libsystemd-dev. 

To link against this library export the environnment variable
WITH_LIBSYSTEMD and set it to true, e. g.: export WITH_LIBSYSTEMD=true
